Our testing process for this milestone was to focus on the initial game configuration page where you can enter a
username, select a difficulty, and select a weapon. We wanted to ensure that the correct exceptions would be thrown
for each item which wouldn't allow the user to progress towards the starting point of the game unless all items were
properly selected. We also wanted to test that the correct gold amount would be displayed based on the difficulty chosen.
We decided to test on these three components heavily because they serve as the backbone of the game currently and without
any of those three items the game wouldn't be able to progress. For example, if a user was able to progress past the
initial configuration screen without selecting a difficulty, but selected a name and a weapon, the user would run into
the problem of an incorrect gold amount. This could ruin the entire game for them and the same level of importance of
difficulty goes for the name and weapon as well.

Explanation of Tests by File
SecondaryControllerTest

testDifficulty() test verifies that the code functions as expected since it throws an InvalidDifficultyException if the
difficulty is null which means no difficulty was chosen.

testArcheType() test  verifies that the code functions as expected since it throws an InvalidArchetypeException if the
archetype is null which means no archetype(weapon) was chosen.
